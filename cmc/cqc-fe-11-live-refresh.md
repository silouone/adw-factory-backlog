# The list and the open drawer refresh themselves while a check is running

Polling (spec `docs/cqc/spec-cqc-fe-release-1.md`, user stories 14 and 27;
"Data fetching: polling").

## Base and what already exists (read first)

- **Base branch: `cqc/release-1`**, not `master`. Your work branches from it and your PR
  targets it; the operator merges there. The whole page reaches `master` later in one PR for
  the CLB team. Never target `master`.
- **Already on `cqc/release-1`** (from cqc-fe-01 #135 and cqc-fe-02 #136):
  - Route **`/quality`** in `src/app/index.tsx` (production URL `/content/quality`). It is
    deliberately not `/content-quality`: the menu marks items active by path prefix, so that
    path would also light up the "Content" item. The "Content quality" left-menu item links to it.
  - Feature root **`src/components/ContentQuality/index.tsx`**:
    `ContentQuality({ apiBaseUrl?: string })` renders the page header "Content quality" and,
    when `apiBaseUrl` is missing, "Content Quality Checker API is not configured". The route
    passes it `CQC_API_URL`. Extend this root; do not create a second one or a second header.
  - Runtime config **`CQC_API_URL`** in `src/config.ts` (container `APP_CQC_API_URL` → nginx SSI
    → `window.GO1.CQC_API_URL`), normalised by `runtimeValue()`: `undefined` means not configured.
  - **No feature gate.** Statsig was dropped (spec D-1 amended 2026-09-28): the page is visible to
    every CMC user. Do not add any gating.
- **No live backend yet.** Test against a mocked CQC service. The API shape is
  `docs/cqc/backend-contract.md`; the backend's canonical spec (same paths and types) lives in
  the content-quality-checker repo and becomes `backend/openapi.yaml` later.
- **Tests in this repo** (`.agents/overlay/TESTING-NOTES.md`): passive effects do not flush after
  RTL `render`/`fireEvent`; use the `ReactDOM.render` flush wrapper it documents. TS 3.5 has no
  `keyCode` in `fireEvent` init objects (use `{ key: "..." }`). tslint enforces `prefer-for-of`.
- **Go1d offline:** the sandbox cannot reach the Go1d source. Verify components and props against
  the installed `@go1d/go1d` type definitions and state the CMC-RX-13 exception in the PR
  description; do not search the web or the disk for the Go1d repository.

- **From cqc-fe-03 (#137), reuse, don't duplicate:**
  - Service `src/services/ContentQuality.service.ts`: `new ContentQualityApi(apiBaseUrl, jwt)`, `listContent(params)`, typed DTOs (`RunSummary`, `ContentRow`, `ContentSummary`, `ContentFacets`, `ContentListResponse`, `ContentListParams`) and `ContentQualityServiceError`. Add new endpoints as methods here.
  - Pure domain `src/components/ContentQuality/domain.ts`: `JOURNEY_ORDER`, `sortChecksByJourney`, `getCheckLabel`, `getStatusLabel`, `getContentUrgency`, `sortContentRows`. Extend it for new domain rules; test it directly (`domain.test.ts`).
  - List `src/components/ContentQuality/CheckedContentList/` (table, `columns.tsx`, `PAGE_LIMIT = 20`) and `common/formatMissing.ts` (the `N/A` rule).
  - URL state `CheckedContentList/useCheckedContentListParams.ts` reads `offset` and `lo`. ⚠️ Today `onPageChange` pushes `{ offset }` and `onOpen` pushes `{ lo }`, each **replacing the whole query**. Any ticket that adds URL state (filters, `run`, drawer params) must first make these pushes **merge** into the current query, with a test that paging keeps the filters and opening a row keeps the page.

## What to build

- While any run in the list or the open drawer is non-terminal (queued,
  provisioning, preflight, running, finalising), refetch the list and the
  open run every 10 seconds. Stop when every run is terminal. Restart when a
  new run appears, for example after a trigger.
- An **"In progress" strip** above the list shows the running checks with their progress.
- Refetching must not reset the drawer's tab, focused check or scroll, and
  must not steal focus.
- Polling stops when the page unmounts.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] With fake timers, a list containing an active run refetches at 10 s. When the mocked response makes all runs terminal, no further request happens.
- [ ] A list with only terminal runs never polls.
- [ ] The open drawer's run refetches while it is non-terminal and updates the verdict when it finishes, keeping the active tab.
- [ ] The "In progress" strip lists active runs with progress and disappears when none remain.
- [ ] Unmounting the page stops all timers.

## Constraints

- Tests and the build run only in the factory gates (Docker, Node 14). The host has Node 25 and the sandbox has no network, so do not run `npm test`, `npm run build` or `pnpm` locally. Do not edit `package.json`, the lockfile, or the jest, webpack or tsconfig configuration.
- Read `AGENTS.md` and `references/data-and-state.md` before editing. Check whether the repository already has a poller component and reuse it if it fits.
- TypeScript 3.5 and React 16.8: no `?.`, no `??`, no `Array.flat`/`flatMap`.

## Verify

The factory gates run tslint, jest and `npm run build` (which type-checks) in Docker `node:14.21.3`.
